<h2>About</h2>

Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multiple robots as a system which consists of 
large numbers of mostly simple physical robots. It is supposed that a desired collective
behavior emerges from the interactions between the robots and interactions of robots with the environment. 
This approach developed in the field of artificial swarm intelligence, from the 
biological studies of insects, ants and other fields in nature where swarm behaviour occurs.In
this project, we tried to simulate that swarm behaviour in that our robots to coordinate with each 
other and try to form the shape that the user inputs while taking care that the distance covered 
and the time taken for the formation of the shape is optimal. We also take care that the 
robots do not collide while following their paths, using the Conflict Based
Search (CBS) algorithm and infrared (IR) sensors. We show an example case - how the algorithm 
works, and how the robots attempt to form the shape optimally.
